    <h1>Tongue Twisters!</h1>

    <h2>Here are some some of my favorite tricky tongue twisters:</h2>


    <ul>
      <li>She sells seashells by the seashore.
      <img src="attached_assets/seashells.jpg" alt="A collection of seashells that are, shockingly, at the seashore.">       </li>
      <li>How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
      <img src="attached_assets/woodchuck.jpg" alt="A woodchuck that sadly isn't chucking wood."></li>
      <li>Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear. Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair. Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy, was he?
